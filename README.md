# PHYS220 CW 3

**Author(s):** _\<Saktill>_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-03-saktill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-03-saktill)

**Due date:** 2016/09/20

## Specification

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

Note: Use your best judgment for how to properly organize your code into functions and modules. Use the problems as guidelines for the idea, but write the best code you can. Plot only in Jupyter, loading modules of .py files as needed.

1. Exercise 5.3 (```fill_arrays_vectorized.py```)
1. Exercise 5.9 (```plot_ball1.py```)
1. Exercise 5.13 (```plot_trajectory.py```)
1. Exercise 5.14 (```read_2columns.py```)

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```cw3.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section. Check that exporting the notebook to pdf via LaTeX produces nice results.

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

Again, this assignment got us more comfortable with both creating python modules for mathematical code and with using Jupyter to present said code, or said math function. In particular, although none of the files included in this assignment have test_functions, trying in vain to make them for our code did help us to write better code. However, everything Sakthi and I talked to you about will be applied to future assignments, as doing that will be much more productive than trying to go back and fix our code to make it testable; which I suppose is actually a pretty solid argument for using the tests from the beginning. 

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
